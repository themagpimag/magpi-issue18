Welcome to issue 18 of The MagPi, a free to download community driven magazine, packed to the brim with all things Raspberry Pi.

The Raspberry Pi foundation has just released their Pi NoiR, an adapted version of their camera with the infra-red filter removed.  This month, we have a great article from Andrew Back of RS Components, where he takes you through the steps he used to create a night vision camera to catch critters in his back garden.

We introduce you to a great program called PiVisiion which brings an attractive GUI, allowing you to control the module through it's native apps.  We have a very informative article on Google at CERN and we look at using Scratch with BrickPi.
 
We also see the first in a series of articles titled 'Project Curacao', an environmental monitoring system utilising the Raspberry Pi which will be hung unattended on a radio tower on the island nation of Curacao.  Exotic!

Of course this only scratches the surface of what we have in store with more favourites on coding, reviews and new products in the world of the Raspberry Pi.

Hope you enjoy.
